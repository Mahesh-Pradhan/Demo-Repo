In a modular approach, each tier is further divided into smaller, reusable components or modules that can be developed and managed independently. This allows for greater flexibility and agility in building and deploying applications.

The above Terraform configuration file deploys a three-tier architecture on AWS, consisting of a VPC, a public subnet, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), a launch configuration, a security group, and a Route53 record.

The AWS provider block is used to specify the credentials to be used for the deployment, including the access_key and secret_key values. The region is also specified as "ap-south-1".

The aws_vpc resource block creates a new VPC with a CIDR block of "10.0.0.0/16".

The aws_subnet resource block creates a public subnet within the VPC with a CIDR block of "10.0.1.0/24". The vpc_id attribute is set to the ID of the VPC created earlier using the aws_vpc resource block.

The aws_lb resource block creates a new Application Load Balancer with the name "epam4325-alb". The subnets attribute is set to the ID of the subnet created earlier using the aws_subnet resource block. An access log is also enabled to track requests made to the ALB.

The aws_launch_configuration resource block creates a new launch configuration with the name "11904325". The image_id attribute is left blank, which means that the default AMI for the specified region will be used. The user_data block contains a basic Bash script to echo "Hello World" to the index.html file.

The aws_security_group resource block creates a new security group with the name prefix "epam4325-sg". The vpc_id attribute is set to the ID of the VPC created earlier using the aws_vpc resource block. Ingress rules are specified to allow incoming traffic on port 80 from any IP address, and egress rules are specified to allow outgoing traffic to any IP address.

The aws_route53_record resource block creates a new Route53 record for the ALB with the name "epam4325.com". The zone_id attribute is set to the ID of the Route53 zone where the record should be created. The alias block specifies the DNS name of the ALB and sets evaluate_target_health to true to enable health checks.

Overall, this Terraform configuration file creates a basic three-tier architecture on AWS with a VPC, public subnet, ALB, launch configuration, security group, and Route53 record. Note that some values, such as the image_id, zone_id, and access_key/secret_key values, would need to be provided for this code to work correctly.
